# Turntable web

I always don't know what to eat every day. But the trying to use this turntable will only leads to my dissatisfaction with the result.

Maybe I should learn from Feynman.

> When Feynman was a professor at Cornell University, he would eat lunch in the cafeteria every day. He noticed that he would always get stuck on a trivial decision: "What should I have for dessert today? The apple pie or the chocolate cake?"
>
> He realized that this minor choice was consuming his mental energy and making him feel anxious. To eliminate this "Decision Fatigue," he established a strict rule for himself:
>
> From now on, whenever I go to the cafeteria, I will simply take the chocolate cake.
>
> No matter what other options were available that day, he would automatically grab the chocolate cake without thinking. By setting this "default option," he minimized the waste of brainpower on trivial matters, saving his mind for solving physics problems.

This anecdote comes from his autobiography, *Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!.*
